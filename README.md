2) every team should work in his own branch.
4) merging to main branch is by request, and done with a devOps team member.

## Merging into "main" = Going to Production
Merging into main will be done in the following process:
1) back-merge <your_brach> into local <main>, fixing any merging issues. 
2) push request to <main> in gitHub (origin) - with a DevOps team member only. (This will update the server)
